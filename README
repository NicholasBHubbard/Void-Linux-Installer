a Void Linux installer

This script is very destructive. Only use this after reading and understanding the code.

After connecting to the internet from the installation OS ...

```
$ xbps-install -Syu xbps git
$ git clone https://github.com/NicholasBHubbard/Void-Linux-Installer
$ cd Void-Linux-Installer
$ ./void-installer
```
